ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new things every day, particularly in computer science, maths and electronics. I love applying my knowledge in the field of engineering, finding new solutions to given issues in electronics and software.

---

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently perfecting my skills on a computer science bachelor, online courses and open-source projects.

---

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on almost any kind of project. I'm looking for experience in the area and continuously developing my skills.
